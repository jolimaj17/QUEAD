<p>Bagtikan is known as one of the light red Philippine mahogany that is known as white lauan in the market. It is a prominent tree that reaches a height of 35 to 40 meters. Its crown is flat and spreading, with a tendency to outgrow its neighboring trees. The cylindrical bole is from 20 to 25 meters long. The leaves are entire, alternate, and scattered, oblong, pale green beneath, rounded at the base, and shiny. The midrib is very pronounced with five to eight pairs of equally prominent nerves. Bagtikan has yellow flowers tinged with pink, which fall in such a great quantity that they almost cover the ground under the flowering tree. The ovary is hairy. The fruiting calyx has five long wings but their bases are not tightly enclosing the fruit as with those of the Shorea genus. The fruits are less than two centimeters in diameter at maturity. The development of bagtikan fruit takes three to four months. However, development varies in different regions in the Philippines due to variance in climate. The bark of the bagtikan tree has broken ridges 3.8 to 4.3 centimeters thick. The stem bark when cut goes reddish in color while the bark at the buttress when cut turns white.<p>

<h2>White Lauan</h2>
<p>Common Name: White Lauan</p>
<p>Family: Dipterocarpaceae</p>
<p>Relative Abundance: Abundant</p>
<p>The white lauan belongs to the dipterocarp family, a group of important timber trees that dominate the lowland rainforests of Asia. The white lauan has brown to nearly black bark, although it can look grey when exposed to bright sunlight. The upper part of the trunk may have distinct longitudinal ridges. The leaves of the white lauan have a thin, leathery texture and can measure up to 29 centimetres long and 11 centimetres wide. Dipterocarp plants have fairly large and showy flowers, to attract insects, and the fruit is a single-seeded nut enclosed within a winged case. Height: up to 50 m and Trunk diameter: up to 182 cm.</p>
