<h2>Philippine Wild Boar</h2>
<p>Common Name: Philippine Wild Boar, Baboy Damo</p>
<p>Relative Abundance: Moderate</p>
<p>The Philippine Wild Boar or baboy damo, a rare and unique breed of pig found only in five areas in the Philippines, has been classified by a world conservation group as “vulnerable” or “threatened.”
The Philippine warty pig (scientific name: Sus Philippensis) is now included in the “red list” of The World Conservation Union (IUCN) and is considered as rare and declining.
Baboy damo, widely distributed in the still-forested areas of Luzon, Mindoro, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao, is a bizarre-looking forest-dweller with coarse, blackish coat and white hair on the sides. 
Its long, stiff hair form a crest running down the middle of its back, and this is particularly conspicuous in males during the breeding season.X
The animal’s medium-length tail has a tuft of long, black hair at the tip, used to swat away flies and signal mood.
The baboy damo survives in forested areas but intense hunting for its meat and extreme levels of deforestation are slowly causing its disappearance.
These threats are amplified by the rapid human population growth in the Philippines, and illegal logging.
Local farmers consider baboy damo to be legitimate targets for reprisal hunting.
Hybridization with free-ranging domestic pigs is also said to be threatening the existence of the baboy damo.
The baboy damo is fully protected by Philippine law, though there is little or no effective enforcement of the relevant legislation in most areas like in Mindoro and Mindanao, where baboy damo abound in national parks.<p>

<h2>Salamander</h2>
<p>Common Name: Salamander</p>

<p>Salamanders encompass approximately 500 species of amphibians. They typically have slender bodies, short legs, and long tails. Usually found in moist or arid habitats in the northern hemisphere, most salamanders are small, although there are two species that reach up to 5 feet in length.
Salamander is a type of amphibian, close relative of frogs and toads. They live mostly in the northern hemisphere, in the wet areas near the lakes and ponds. Depending on the species, some salamanders spend their life in the water, other on the land, while the most species live part of their life in the water, and part on the land. There are 500 known species of salamanders. Large percent of them is endangered due to habitat loss and pollution.<p>

<h2>Snakes</h2>
<p>Common Name: Snakes</p>
<p>Relative Abundance: Few</p>
<p>Snakes belong to the animal class reptiles.  This group also includes crocodiles, lizards, and turtles.  Reptiles are cold-blooded animals that raise their body temperature by lying in the sun or lower it by crawling into the shade.  Their body temperature changes to the temperature of its surroundings.  Because of this, snakes that live in colder climates must hibernate through the winter.  They will find burrows or caves and fall into a deep sleep until the weather becomes ware enough for them.
There are more than 2,900 species of snakes in the world.  They live almost everywhere, in deserts, forests, oceans, streams, and lakes.  Snakes live on the ground, in trees, and in water.
Snakes cannot survive in places where the ground stays frozen year round so there are no snakes north of the Arctic Circle or in Antarctica.  Some islands, including Ireland and New Zealand, do not have snakes at all.<p>

<h2>Monitor Lizard</h2>
<p>Common Name: Monitor Lizard</p>
<p>Scientific Name: Varanus Salvatore</p>
<p>Relative Abundance: Rare</p>
<p>Monitor Lizards are large reptiles found in Africa and all across Asia, including the surrounding seas. The monitor lizard is mainly found in jungle areas although some species of monitor lizard are water-bound.
Some species of monitor lizard are thought to carry a fairly weak venom, for example, the komodo dragonwhich is the largest of the species. The komodo dragon is native to the small Indonesian island that it is named after and is the largest species of lizard in the world.
According to legend, monitor lizards were a sign that there were crocodiles close by, possibly due to their standing on their hind legs to monitor their surroundings. Monitor lizards do this so that they are aware of any approaching predators.
Although many species of monitor lizard are quite big, some species of monitor lizard are smaller than 20 cm in length. Monitor lizards are extremely versatile animals and monitor lizards adapt well into different environments.
Most species of monitor lizard have a predominantly carnivorous diet, eating eggs, smaller reptiles, fish, birds and small mammals. Some species of monitor lizard also eat fruit and vegetation depending on where they live.
Female monitor lizards bury their eggs in holes or hollow tree stumps that the female monitor lizard then covers with dirt in order to protect her eggs. Monitor lizards can lay up to 30 eggs at a time, although many monitor lizards lay less, and only a lucky few of the monitor lizard babies tend to survive.
Monitor lizards are thought to be fairly intelligent animals, with some people claiming that monitor lizards are able to recognise numbers up to six, therefore meaning that monitor lizards are able to count! Monitor lizards mainly use their intelligence in the wild by surveying areas for oncoming danger and for hunting their prey.<p>

<h2>Tuko</h2>
<p>Common Name:Tuko</p>
<p>Scientific Name: Gecko</p>
<p>Relative Abundance: Few</p>
<p>Geckos are reptiles and are found on all the continents except Antarctica. These colorful lizards have adapted to habitats from rain forests, to deserts, to cold mountain slopes. 

Over a long period of time, geckos have developed special physical features to help them survive and avoid predators. Gecko tails serve many purposes. They help balance their weight as they climb branches, they act as fuel tanks to store fat, and as camouflage to help them disappear into their environment. Geckos are also able to shed their tails if a predator grabs them. 

Most geckos are nocturnal, which means they are active at night, but day geckos are active during the day and nibble on insects, fruits, and flower nectar. Most geckos make noises such as chirping, barking, and clicking when they are defending their territory or attracting a mate. 

Female geckos lay their eggs in leaves and bark. Most geckos don’t have movable eyelids and instead have one transparent eyelid which they keep clean by licking it with their tongues. 

There are many species of geckos. Depending on the species, their endangered status can range from least concern to critically endangered.</p>
